# pngvessels
A puzzle game for VR where you match the pots to the community that made them using clues (and guesses). Based on Three.js example code.
Pots designed based on photos and drawings (sources listed on reference panel). Copyright to the PNG communities. The models were designed for 3D printing in miniature, the real PNG pots are much more detailed and complex. Locations of language groups are approximate. 
If you reuse the pot models they can not be used in a derogatory manner.
