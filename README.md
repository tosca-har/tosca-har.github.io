# Virtual_petrography
 Prototype for VR petrography gallery.
 Images were taken by Kristine Hardy, of the petrography slides of William Dickinson, held at the Bishop Museum, Hawai'i.
 Any reuse of images must attribute William Dickinson and the Bishop Museum. Descriptions by W. Dickinson. Send me a message if you disagree with his mineral identifications (or if I've made a mistake anywhere- including map co-ordinates).
 
 Based on three.js VR drag example.
